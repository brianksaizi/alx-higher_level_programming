## Background Context
Welcome to the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)! This project introduces you to the concept of OOP, even if you think you already know about it. It's important to read and understand the provided material to grasp the fundamental concepts. Remember to experiment and play with OOP to truly understand it.

Read or watch the following resources in order:

### Resources
- Read or watch:
    - [Object Oriented Programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html) (Read everything until the paragraph ‚ÄúInheritance‚Äù excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod and staticmethod yet)
    - [Object-Oriented Programming](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Classes.html) (Be careful: read the paragraphs for a better understanding of concepts in Python 3)
    - [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php)
    - [Learn to Program 9: Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfzJzE1DDxA)
    - [Python Classes and Objects](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/class)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will:

- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Grasp the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Learn about "first-class everything."
- Define and distinguish between classes and objects or instances.
- Explore the concepts of attributes, methods, and special methods.
- Master the usage of public, protected, and private attributes.
- Understand the purpose and usage of the `__init__` method.
- Learn about Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
- Understand the difference between attributes and properties in Python.
- Implement getters and setters the Pythonic way.
- Be able to create arbitrary new attributes dynamically for instances.
- Gain insights into binding attributes to objects and classes.
- Understand the `__dict__` attribute and its contents.
- Learn how Python finds attributes of objects or classes.
- Utilize the `getattr` function.
